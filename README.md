HTML/CSS/JavaScript Recipe Website for Chilli Paneer Recipe from allrecipes.com


CSS: I would like to you add in some reviews to your recipe page using the general layout from
https://www.metacritic.com/. Take a look at a game a that you know like Mario Party, and take
a look at how the reviews look. Use some of the information that you learned about layouts
and css to refine your recipe webpage to make it look a little bit nicer, and then add in 3
reviews. You are welcome to take a look at new information as well.
Example below:

If you are looking to arrange elements inside of a container like a div, you should check out
Flexbox. There are some really good tutorials that you can use.
You should use the following:
⦁ One basic positioning type
⦁ Change the font
⦁ Change the alignment
⦁ Class / id
⦁ A basic use of flexbox

JavaScript: There are a number of widgets and potential CSS enhancements
you can make to your allrecipes site.   I would like you to add a slider that will let
the user to adjust the serving size the meal. 
You should create some type of basic conversion for all of the ingredients,
and provide a clean UI solution to view all of them.  You should set the slider so it has a minimum
and maximum that are relevant for dish being cooked.  The slider should have its own custom css with
a few modifications that you think fit with the theme of your application.  Make sure to change the image of the actual
slider to something that fits with a food theme.
